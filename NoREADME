# Imgur Uploader

**Check the [running app](https://imguruploader.herokuapp.com/)**

Did you know that lately Imgur has removed some great features and is not willing to take them back?
Yup, that's it! [They just said so](https://twitter.com/imgur/status/660210611914080256).

In particular, the _Generate multiple links_ feature allowed to generate several links in different formats
for a group of images. It was very useful for embedding several images in a forum or your website. But
that feature is gone for good!

This is a very simple website that allows you to upload your images to Imgur and generate multiple links at once.
